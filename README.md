## CircuitPython_LED

### Description & Code Snippets
The goal for this assignment was to get the LED working the same as we could on the arduino. However, due to some unforseen problems with circuit python we ended up using the neopixel instead. This code assigns the necessary values to the neopixel and then output the rainbow to the neopixel.

### Wiring

There is no wiring for this assignment.

### Reflection
Getting the circuit python setup was difficult, and if I were to do this again I would skip the step of using Mu. Overall, it wasn't hard to complete this assignment because the code was supplied to us and there was no wiring.



## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code Snippets
The goal of this assignment was to wire a servo to move with capacitive touch from two wires. The overall idea was vague, but it wasn't to hard to find and modify two pieces of code from adafruit to achieve our goal.

import time
import board
import touchio
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.ContinuousServo(pwm)

touch_A4 = touchio.TouchIn(board.A4)  # Not a touch pin on Trinket M0!
touch_A5 = touchio.TouchIn(board.A5)  # Not a touch pin on Trinket M0!

while True:
    my_servo.throttle = 0.0
    while touch_A4.value:
        my_servo.throttle = 1.0
        time.sleep(.5)
    while touch_A5.value:
        my_servo.throttle = -1.0
        time.sleep(.5)
```

 


### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.



Here is how you should give image credit to someone if you use their work:

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**


## CircuitPython_LCD

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
Then post an image here.   [Here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
